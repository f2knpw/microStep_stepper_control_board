# microStep_stepper_control_board
a control board for LMD1845 H bridge driver

LMD1845 drivers allow to control bipolar motors at 55V and 3A.
This project is a simple implementation of a driver for these chips.
Fully written in assembler and using PIC16F57 it has proven to be extremly reliable over years (15 years of operations in 2024 !)
